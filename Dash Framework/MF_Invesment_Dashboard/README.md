## âš¡ Embedding a Dash Application into Web Application:


An HTML iframe tag can be used to embed a Dash application into a web application by running the Dash application as a server. To embed a Dash app into a web application, follow these steps:

1. Host Dash application on server.
2. Access the url where application was hosted.
3. Embed those url in web application.
    
```bash 
<iframe src="http://127.0.0.1:8050/" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
**Note: Embedding a Dash app in this way means that your Dash app is running as a standalone server, and it will need to be accessible to the users of your web application. If your web application and the Dash app are hosted separately, you may need to consider CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies and ensure that the server running your Dash app allows requests from your web application's domain.**



## âš¡ Conclusion

Using a dash framework, this project aims to create an interactive dashboard.Â Additionally, it provides knowledge of how to embed DashÂ applicationsÂ intoÂ webÂ applications.Â
